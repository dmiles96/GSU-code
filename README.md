# GSU-code
This repository contains code from coursework during my PhD program at GSU. Below, you'll find a brief description of each file.

[Logit and Probit Regression](/Logit%20and%20Probit%20Regression.pdf)

    ## This PDF displays an example of code that myself and other students were required to complete when discussing logit and probit regressions in class. Furthermore, this is an example of the 'hands on' experience I obtained during the semester.

[Week 2_Linear Regression](/Week%202_Linear%20Regression.R)

    ## This Rscript is a direct result of running code during coursework pertaining to linear regressing and how to observe varibles of interest and if there is any correclation between the two variables or if there is no correlation associated with variables of interest.

[final data analysis](/final%20data%20analysis.R)

    ## This Rscript is a summary of all the various types of analyses we have learned throughout the semester. This file showcases how I selected certain variables, how I isolated them and chose them based on detailed instructions by the instructor, and ultimately guiding me to interpretting the data based on the results of numerous tests conducted within R commander. 

[final exam q2](/final%20exam%20q2.R)

    ## This Rscript is a summary of all the various types of analyses we have learned throughout the semester. This file showcases how I selected certain variables, how I isolated them and chose them based on detailed instructions by the instructor, and ultimately guiding me to interpretting the data based on the results of numerous tests conducted within R commander. 

[research project analysis](/research%20project%20analysis.R)

    ## This Rscript details specific variables of interests and the relationships between such variables. This file is associated with my final project for my Advanced Quantitative Methods course and all variables and decisions made within this file was up to my sole discretion. I was responsible for choosing, analyzing, and interpretting results with selected variables and either supporting or rejecting my hypothesis for this specific project.
